To explicitly specialize the compiler use the cmake options `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`.
For example to use clang-12 compiler install it and add the following options to cmake:
`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-12 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-12`

### Downloading packages using CPM

userver uses [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for downloading missing packages.

By default, we first try to find the corresponding system package.
With `USERVER_FORCE_DOWNLOAD_PACKAGES=ON`, no such attempt is made, and we skip straight to `CPMAddPackage`.
This can be useful to guarantee that the build uses the latest (known to userver) versions of third-party packages.

You can control the usage of CPM with `USERVER_DOWNLOAD_*` options.
For example, `USERVER_DOWNLOAD_PACKAGES=OFF` is useful for CI and other controlled environments
to make sure that no download attempts are made, which ensures repeatability and the best CI build speed.

For details on the download options, refer to [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) documentation.
Some advice:

- `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` helps to avoid re-downloads with multiple userver build modes or multiple CPM-using projects;
- `CPM_USE_NAMED_CACHE_DIRECTORIES` (which userver enables by default) avoids junk library names shown in IDEs.


## Build dependencies and instructions for userver based services

There are prepared and ready to use service templates at the github:

* https://github.com/userver-framework/service_template
* https://github.com/userver-framework/pg_service_template
* https://github.com/userver-framework/pg_grpc_service_template

Just use the template to make your own service:
1. Press the green "Use this template" button at the top of the github template page
2. Clone the service `git clone your-service-repo && cd your-service-repo && git submodule update --init`
3. Give a proper name to your service and replace all the occurrences of "*service_template" string with that name.
4. Feel free to tweak, adjust or fully rewrite the source code of your service.

For local development of your service either
* use the docker build and tests run via `make docker-test`;
* or install the build dependencies on your local system and
  adjust the `Makefile.local` file to provide \b platform-specific \b CMake
  options to the template:

  ```

\b Recommended \b Makefile.local:
  ```

      -DUSERVER_PG_SERVER_LIBRARY_DIR=$(pg_config --pkglibdir) -DUSERVER_PG_SERVER_INCLUDE_DIR=$(pg_config --includedir-server)
  ```

After that the `make test` would build and run the service tests.

@warning MacOS is recommended only for development as it may have performance issues in some cases.


### Other POSIX based platforms

🐙 **userver** works well on modern POSIX platforms. Follow the cmake hints for the installation of required packets and experiment with the CMake options.

Feel free to provide a PR with instructions for your favorite platform at https://github.com/userver-framework/userver.

If there's a strong need to build \b only the userver and run its tests, then see
@ref scripts/docs/en/userver/tutorial/build_userver.md



@anchor POSTGRES_LIBS
## PostgreSQL versions
If CMake option `USERVER_FEATURE_PATCH_LIBPQ` is on, then the same developer
version of libpq, libpgport and libpgcommon libraries should be available on
the system. If there are multiple versions of those libraries use USERVER_PG_*
CMake options to aid the build system in finding the right version.

You could also install any version of the above libraries by explicitly pinning
the version. For example in Debian/Ubuntu pinning to version 14 could be done
via the following commands:
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
echo "deb https://apt-archive.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt jammy-pgdg-archive main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
sudo apt update

sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/preferences.d

printf "Package: postgresql-14\nPin: version 14.5*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/postgresql-14
printf "Package: postgresql-client-14\nPin: version 14.5*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/postgresql-client-14
sudo apt install --allow-downgrades -y postgresql-14 postgresql-client-14

printf "Package: libpq5\nPin: version 14.5*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/libpq5
printf "Package: libpq-dev\nPin: version 14.5*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n"| sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/libpq-dev
sudo apt install --allow-downgrades -y libpq5 libpq-dev
```
