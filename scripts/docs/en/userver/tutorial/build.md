## Configure, Build and Install

## Quick start for beginners

1\. clone service template and userver repositories


```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/userver-framework/service_template.git && \
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/userver-framework/userver.git service_template/third_party/userver && \
cd service_template
```

More information about the service template can be found here: @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/tutorial/hello_service.md

2\. install build dependencies for userver

see build dependencies here: @ref service_templates

for example to install @ref ubuntu_22_04 build dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt install --allow-downgrades -y $(cat third_party/userver/scripts/docs/en/deps/ubuntu-22.04.md | tr '\n' ' ')
```

3\. build and start hello service

```shell
make build-release && \
make service-start-release
```

During the build, you can make a coffee break until approximately the following output appears:

```shell
====================================================================================================
Started service at http://localhost:8080/, configured monitor URL is http://localhost:-1/
====================================================================================================

PASSED
[service-runner] Service started, use C-c to terminate
INFO     <userver> Server is started
...
DEBUG    <userver> Accepted connection #2/32768
DEBUG    <userver> Incoming connection from ::ffff:127.0.0.1, fd 43

```

4\. try to send request

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello?name=userver
```

The answer should be something like this:

```shell
> curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/hello?name=userver
Hello, userver!
```

5\. Now you are ready for fast and comfortable creation of C++ microservices, services and utilities!

To explicitly specialize the compiler use the cmake options `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`.
For example to use clang-12 compiler install it and add the following options to cmake:
`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-12 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-12`

@warning Using LTO can lead to [some problems](https://github.com/userver-framework/userver/issues/242). We don't recommend using `USERVER_LTO`.

Make sure to:

1. Enable the CMake options to build the libraries you need
2. Link against the libraries

The details vary depending on the method of building userver:

* `add_subsirectory(userver)` as used in @ref service_templates "service templates"
* @ref userver_cpm "CPM"
* @ref userver_conan "Conan"
* @ref userver_install "userver install"


## Downloading packages using CPM

userver uses [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for downloading missing packages.

By default, we first try to find the corresponding system package.
With `USERVER_FORCE_DOWNLOAD_PACKAGES=ON`, no such attempt is made, and we skip straight to `CPMAddPackage`.
This can be useful to guarantee that the build uses the latest (known to userver) versions of third-party packages.

You can control the usage of CPM with `USERVER_DOWNLOAD_*` options.
For example, `USERVER_DOWNLOAD_PACKAGES=OFF` is useful for CI and other controlled environments
to make sure that no download attempts are made, which ensures repeatability and the best CI build speed.

For details on the download options, refer to [CPM](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) documentation.
Some advice:

- `CPM_SOURCE_CACHE` helps to avoid re-downloads with multiple userver build modes or multiple CPM-using projects;
- `CPM_USE_NAMED_CACHE_DIRECTORIES` (which userver enables by default) avoids junk library names shown in IDEs.

@anchor userver_cpm
### Downloading userver using CPM

userver itself can be downloaded and built using CPM.

```cmake
CPMAddPackage(
    NAME userver
    VERSION (userver release version or git commit hash)
    GIT_TAG (userver release version or git commit hash)
    GITHUB_REPOSITORY userver-framework/userver
    OPTIONS
    "USERVER_FEATURE_GRPC ON"
)

target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} userver::grpc)
```

Make sure to enable the CMake options to build userver libraries you need,
then link to those libraries.

@see @ref userver_libraries


@anchor service_templates
## Build dependencies and instructions for userver based services

There are prepared and ready to use service templates at the github:

* https://github.com/userver-framework/service_template
* https://github.com/userver-framework/pg_service_template
* https://github.com/userver-framework/pg_grpc_service_template

Just use the template to make your own service:

1. Press the green "Use this template" button at the top of the github template page
2. Clone the service `git clone your-service-repo && cd your-service-repo`
3. Give a proper name to your service and replace all the occurrences of "*service_template" string with that name.
4. Feel free to tweak, adjust or fully rewrite the source code of your service.

For local development of your service either

* use the docker build and tests run via `make docker-test`;
* or install the build dependencies on your local system and
  adjust the `Makefile.local` file to provide \b platform-specific \b CMake
  options to the template:

The service templates allow to kickstart the development of your production-ready service,
but there can't be a repo for each and every combination of userver libraries.
To use additional userver libraries, e.g. `userver::grpc`, add to the root `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
set(USERVER_FEATURE_GRPC ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
# ...
add_subdirectory(third_party/userver)
# ...
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} userver::grpc)
```

@see @ref userver_libraries

See @ref tutorial_services for minimal usage examples of various userver libraries.

### Yandex Cloud with Ubuntu 22.04

The userver framework is
[available at Yandex Cloud Marketplace](https://yandex.cloud/en/marketplace/products/yc/userver).

To create a VM with preinstalled userver just click the "Create VM" button and
pay for the Cloud hardware usage.

After that the VM is ready to use. SSH to it and use
`find_package(userver REQUIRED)` in the `CMakeLists.txt` to use the preinstalled
userver framework.

If there a need to update the userver in the VM do the following:
```
bash
sudo apt remove libuserver-*

cd /app/userver
sudo git checkout develop
sudo git pull
sudo ./scripts/build_and_install_all.sh
```

  ```

After that the `make test` would build and run the service tests.

@warning MacOS is recommended only for development as it may have performance issues in some cases.


### Other POSIX based platforms

🐙 **userver** works well on modern POSIX platforms. Follow the cmake hints for the installation of required packets and experiment with the CMake options.

Feel free to provide a PR with instructions for your favorite platform at https://github.com/userver-framework/userver.

If there's a strong need to build \b only the userver and run its tests, then see
@ref scripts/docs/en/userver/tutorial/build_userver.md

@anchor userver_install
## Install

You can install userver globally and then use it from anywhere with `find_package`.
Make sure to use the same build mode as for your service, otherwise subtle linkage issues will arise.

### Install with cmake --install

To install userver build it with `USERVER_INSTALL=ON` flags in `Debug` and `Release` modes:
```
cmake -S./ -B./build_debug \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DUSERVER_INSTALL=ON \
    -DUSERVER_SANITIZE="ub addr" \
    -GNinja
cmake -S./ -B./build_release \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DUSERVER_INSTALL=ON \
    -GNinja
cmake --build build_debug/
cmake --build build_release/
cmake --install build_debug/
cmake --install build_release/
```

### Build and install Debian package

To build `libuserver-all-dev.deb` package run the following shell command:

```
docker run --rm -it --network ip6net -v $(pwd):/home/user -w /home/user/userver \
   --entrypoint bash ghcr.io/userver-framework/ubuntu-22.04-userver-base:latest ./scripts/docker/run_as_user.sh \
   ./scripts/build_and_install_all.sh
```

And install the package with the following:

```
sudo dpkg -i ./libuserver-all-dev*.deb
```

### Use userver in your projects
Next, write
```
find_package(userver REQUIRED COMPONENTS core postgresql grpc redis clickhouse mysql rabbitmq mongo)
```
in your `CMakeLists.txt`. Choose only the necessary components.
@see @ref userver_libraries

Finally, link your source with userver component.

For instance:
```
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}_objs PUBLIC userver::postgresql)
```

Done! You can use installed userver.

### Additional information:

Link `mariadbclient` additionally for mysql component:

```
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}-mysql_objs PUBLIC userver::mysql mariadbclient)
```

@anchor POSTGRES_LIBS
## PostgreSQL versions
If CMake option `USERVER_FEATURE_PATCH_LIBPQ` is on, then the same developer
version of libpq, libpgport and libpgcommon libraries should be available on
the system. If there are multiple versions of those libraries use USERVER_PG_*
CMake options to aid the build system in finding the right version.

You could also install any version of the above libraries by explicitly pinning
the version. For example in Debian/Ubuntu pinning to version 14 could be done
via the following commands:
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
echo "deb https://apt-archive.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt jammy-pgdg-archive main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
sudo apt update

sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/preferences.d

printf "Package: postgresql-14\nPin: version 14.5*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/postgresql-14
printf "Package: postgresql-client-14\nPin: version 14.5*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/postgresql-client-14
sudo apt install --allow-downgrades -y postgresql-14 postgresql-client-14

printf "Package: libpq5\nPin: version 14.5*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/libpq5
printf "Package: libpq-dev\nPin: version 14.5*\nPin-Priority: 1001\n"| sudo tee -a /etc/apt/preferences.d/libpq-dev
sudo apt install --allow-downgrades -y libpq5 libpq-dev
```
