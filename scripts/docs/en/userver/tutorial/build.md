To explicitly specialize the compiler use the cmake options `CMAKE_C_COMPILER` and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`.
For example to use clang-12 compiler install it and add the following options to cmake:
`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-12 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-12`

Prefer avoiding Boost versions that are affected by the bug https://github.com/boostorg/lockfree/issues/59 (1.71 and above).

  ```


### MacOS

MacOS recommended only for development as it may have performance issues in some cases. 
At least MacOS 10.15 required with [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Follow the cmake hints for installation of required packets and experiment with the cmake options.


### Other POSIX based platforms

userver works well on modern POSIX platforms. Follow the cmake hints for installation of required packets and experiment with the cmake options.

Feel free to provide a PR with instructions for your favorite platform at https://github.com/userver-framework/userver.

## Run tests
```
bash
cd build_release
ctest -V
```
