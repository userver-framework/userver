## Changelog

### Release v2.4

* Added @ref USERVER_LOG_REQUEST_HEADERS_WHITELIST to control the HTTP headers
  to log.
* OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP) now can optionally do only logging or only
  tracing. Thanks to [TertiumOrganum1](https://github.com/TertiumOrganum1) for
  the PR!
* The framework now accepts OTLP headers for tracing by default and puts those
  headers for new requests. 
* PostgreSQL span names are now a little bit more informative. Thanks to
  [TertiumOrganum1](https://github.com/TertiumOrganum1) for the PR!

* Optimizations:
  * HTTP/2 server implementation now does not copy data to send, saving CPU
    and RAM.
  * HTTP/2 now relies on open-addressing unordered map from nghttp2, leading to
    faster stream lookup.
  * Kafka consumer now does not block a task processor thread, allowing
    multiple consumers to share the same OS thread. Consume cycle now can be
    treated as an asynchronous non-blocking event loop.
  * Kafka producer delivery acknowledgments processing is now done in parallel,
    leading to better scalability. Also it does not block the OS thread when
    waiting for new delivery acknowledgments.
  * Internals of all the Sockets became smaller in size, saving some RAM.

* gRPC:
  * gRPC in testsuite now automatically calls
    @ref pytest_userver.client.Client.update_server_state update_server_state.
    The behavior now matches HTTP.
  * gRPC server now supports unix-sockets via `unix-socket-path` static config
    option.
  * gRPC clients now log requests/responses via the
    ugrpc::client::middlewares::log::Component middleware. Improved gRPC
    client and server metrics.
  * New component ugrpc::client::CommonComponent with common options for all the
    gRPC clients.

* Build, Install and CI:
  * OTLP build is now supported in Conan. Thanks to
    [Amina Ramazanova](https://github.com/konataa) for the PR!
  * Chaotic now exposes less headers, leading to faster build times.
  * Fixed compilation on modern Boost.UUID. Thanks to
    [Alexander Botev](https://github.com/MrSteelRat) for the PR!
  * Added `dependabot` to CI and updated the dependencies. Thanks to
    [Dzmitry Ivaniuk](https://github.com/idzm) for the PR!
  * Added missing `#include`. Thanks to [Nikita](https://github.com/rtkid-nik)
    for the PR!
  * Removed outdated defines in the core. Thanks to
    [Sergey Kazmin](https://github.com/yerseg) for the PR!
  * Install now does not put third party headers into the top level include
    directory. Multiple unused files are now not installed.
  * Started the work to enable builds in directories with whitespace in names.

* Documentation:
  * More docs for gRPC middlewares at @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/grpc.md
    and @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/tutorial/grpc_middleware_service.md.
  * More docs for otlp::LoggerComponent. Thanks to
    [TertiumOrganum1](https://github.com/TertiumOrganum1) for the PR!
  * Set proper `Content-Type` in samples.


### Release v2.3

* Initial HTTP 2.0 server support is now implemented. Use
  `handler-defaults.http_version` static config option of components::Server to
  enable.
* Logger for OpenTelemetry protocol was implemented. Could be enabled via
  `USERVER_FEATURE_OTLP` CMake option. See @ref opentelemetry "the docs" for
  more info.  
* Client address in handler now could be retrieved via
  server::http::HttpRequest::GetRemoteAddress(). Many thanks to
  [Daniil Shvalov](https://github.com/danilshvalov) for the PR.
* The scheduler implementation now could be adjusted for each task_processor
  via `task-processor-queue` static option. A more efficient
  `work-stealing-task-queue` was introduced. Many thanks to
  [Egor Bocharov](https://github.com/egor-bystepdev) for the PR!
* Added storages::postgres::TimePointWithoutTz for more explicit declaration of
  intent. Direct work with std::chrono::system_clock is now deprecated in
  PostgreSQL driver.
* Validation of static config schemas now understands `minItems` and `maxItems`
  for arrays. Many thanks to [eparoshin](https://github.com/eparoshin) for the
  PR.
* Websockets now have case insensitive check of headers. Thanks to
  [Alexander Enaldiev](https://github.com/Turim) for the PR!
* Added engine::io::Socket::ReadNoblock() function to check if there's a
  pending data and read it if any. server::websocket::WebSocketConnection now
  has a TryRecv() function to receive a message if its first bytes already came.
  Thanks to [Alexander Enaldiev](https://github.com/Turim) for the PR!
* `#env`, `#file` and `#fallback` now could be used in `config_vars` file.
  See yaml_config::YamlConfig for more info. Thanks to
  [Artyom Samuylik](https://github.com/Matrix-On) for the PR.
* gRPC
  * Sensitive data now could be hidden in logs via applying a
    `[(userver.field).secret = true]` option to a protobuf field in schema.
  * Generic server now could be implemented via
    ugrpc::server::GenericServiceBase. Generic client
    ugrpc::client::GenericClient was also implemented. The functionality of
    generic client/server is useful for writing gRPC proxies.
  * gRPC server now shows aggregated `grpc.server.total` metrics
  * More samples and docs.
* Optimizations:
  * IO events are now uniformly distributed between ev threads. This leads
    to better performance on high loads in default configurations. Even number
    of ev threads now works as good as odd number of threads.
  * IO watchers now always start asynchronously, leading to x2 less CPU
    consumption for each start+stop operation. As a result ev threads of HTTP
    client and Redis driver now use less CPU.
  * Timer events with reachable deadlines now are deferred if that does not
    affect latencies. This gives ~5% RPS improvement for `service_template`. 
* Build
  * `Find*.cmake` files are not generated any more, leading to simpler code base
    and faster configure times.
  * Fixed incorrect handling of dots in chaotic paths. Thanks to
    [Alexander Chernov](https://github.com/blackav) for the PR!
  * MacOS build options are now part of the CMake files, leading to less
    boilerplate while compiling for that platform. Many thanks to
    [Daniil Shvalov](https://github.com/danilshvalov) for the PR.
  * Kafka driver is now enabled in Conan. Many thanks to
    [Aleksandr Gusev](https://github.com/ALumad) for the PR.
  * Conan related build fixes. Thanks to [Alex](https://github.com/leha-bot) for
    the PR.

    concurrent::StripedCounter. x1000 performance improvement for some edge
    cases, x3 improvement for the generic use case.
  * Internal `TaskCounter` now uses concurrent::StripedCounter to reduce
    contention on atomics on each async task construction and destruction.
  * Adjusted the default spinning count in scheduler to better fit modern
    hardware and typical loads.

### April 2024

* Initial CPack support. Now `userver-all.deb` packages could be build via:
  ```
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/userver-framework/userver.git
  docker run --rm -it --network ip6net -v $(pwd):/home/user -w /home/user/userver \
     --entrypoint bash ghcr.io/userver-framework/ubuntu-22.04-userver-base:latest ./scripts/docker/run_as_user.sh \
     ./scripts/build_and_install_all.sh
  ```
  We'll start publishing the packages soon.

* New Docker images based on Ubuntu-22.04 with weekly builds and publishing:
  * ghcr.io/userver-framework/ubuntu-22.04-userver-pg:latest - image with
    preinstalled userver deb package and PostgreSQL database. All the
    service templates now use it for tests
  * ghcr.io/userver-framework/ubuntu-22.04-userver:latest - image with
    preinstalled userver deb package. Good starting container for
    developing servers that do not use POstgreSQL.
  * ghcr.io/userver-framework/ubuntu-22.04-userver-base:latest - an image
    with only the build dependencies to build userver. Good for development of
    userver itself.
  More info at @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/tutorial/build.md

* All the service templates were moved to a new components naming with `::`
  (for example `userver::core`) and
  now attempt to find an installed userver. Now in CMake component names with
  `::` work regardless of the framework installation (CPM, `add_subdirectory`,
  or `find_package`).

* Added userver/utils/hedged_request.hpp with a bunch of helper classes to
  perform hedged requests.
* Improved testsuite logging for
  @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/functional_testing.md "functional tests".
* Consumers of concurrent queues now have a Reset() method. Thanks to
  [akhoroshev](https://github.com/akhoroshev) for the PR!
* Fixed gRPC builds and runs with ASAN. Thanks to
  [Nikita](https://github.com/root-kidik) for the PR!
* Published early work on Kafka driver. API is not stable, build scripts,
  improvements and samples to come. Thanks to [Fedor](https://github.com/fdr896)
  for the work!
* Published early work on RocksDB driver. API is not stable, build scripts,
  improvements and samples to come. Thanks to
  [Kirill](https://github.com/Shuba-Buba) for the work!

* Optimizations:
  * WriteAll for TLS became up to 7 times faster if multiple small chunks of
    data are written. Thanks to [–ò–ª—å—è –û–ø–ª–∞—á–∫–∏–Ω](https://github.com/IoplachkinI)
    and [VScdr](https://github.com/VS-CDR) for the PR!
  * Binary sizes were reduced if building without LTO. All the binaries linked
    with userver became about 1MB smaller.
  * Implemented asymmetric thread fences. This opens the door for optimizations
    of rcu::Variable and internals of the scheduler.
  * Caches in testsuite are now invalidated concurrently, leading to tens of
    seconds speedup for services with multiple caches and tests.
  * concurrent::StripedCounter became 8 times more memory efficient.

* Build and docs:
  * Updated PostgreSQL CMake scripts for Manjaro. Thanks to
    [Ivan Gabrusevich](https://github.com/sddwbbs) for the PR!

  logging.
* Now all the modern versions of `libmongoc` are supported in `userver-mongo`.
* @ref POSTGRES_CONNLIMIT_MODE_AUTO_ENABLED is now `on` by default.
* A secret value for the digest nonce generating now could be provided in
  `http_server_digest_auth_secret` key via components::Secdist. Many thanks to
  [Mingaripov Niyaz](https://github.com/mnink275) for the PR!
* ugrpc::server::ServerComponent now has a `unix-socket-path` static option to
  listen on unix domain socket path instead of an inet socket.
* All the `formats::*::ValueBuilder` now support std::string_view. Thanks to
  –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –ë—É–¥–∏–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π for the bug report!
* clients::http::Form is now movable and slightly more efficient. Thanks to
  [Alexandr Kondratev](https://github.com/theg4sh) for the PR!
* Redis now supports `SSUBSCRIBE` and removes dead nodes.
* engine::WaitAny() now can wait for an engine::io::Socket/engine::io::TlsWrapper
  to become readable or writable. For example:
  `engine::WaitAny(socket.GetReadableBase(), task1, tls_socket.GetWritableBase(), future1);`
* New tracing::Span::MakeRootSpan() helper function.

* Optimizations:
  * Switched from unmaintained `http_parser` to a 156% faster `llhttp`.
  * Implemented a concurrent::StripedCounter that allows to have a per-cpu data
    in user space with kernel-provided transactional guarantees. Works
    at least x2 faster than std::atomic on a single thread and scales
    linearly (unlike std::atomic). As a result gives more than x10 performance
    improvement under heavy contention.
  * An explicit control over cache invalidations in testsuite. As a result,
    less caches are invalidated between tests and the overall time to run tests
    goes down significantly.
  * Components start was optimized to copy less containers during component
    dependencies detection.
  * Per each incoming HTTP request:
    * one less `std::chrono::steady_clock::now()` call
    * one less `StrCaseHash` construction (2 calls into `std::uniform_int_distribution<std::uint64_t>` over `std::mt19937`)
    * one less `dynamic_config::Snapshot` construction (at least one atomic CAS)
  * HTTP Client now copies less `std::shared_ptr` variables in implementation.
  * Optimized up to an order of magnitude the user types query in PostgreSQL
    driver.
  * pytest_userver.client.Client.capture_logs() now accepts `log_level` to
    filter out messages with lower log level in the service itself and minimize
    CPU and memory consumption during tests.
  * Up to two times faster utils::statistics::RecentPeriod statistics in
    PostgreSQL driver due to switching to a utils::datetime::SteadyCoarseClock.

* Build:
  * Workarounds for the Protobuf >= 5.26.0
  * Removed redundant semicolon, thanks to Oleksii Demchenko for the
    [PR](https://github.com/userver-framework/userver/commit/b3abb84d6bb1da693).
  * utils::FastScopeGuard now uses proper traits. Thanks to
    [–ò–ª—å—è –û–ø–ª–∞—á–∫–∏–Ω](https://github.com/IoplachkinI) for the PR and to
    [Artyom Kolpakov](https://github.com/ddvamp) for the report!
  * Added missing dependency for Arch based distros. Thanks to
    [VScdr](https://github.com/VS-CDR) for the PR!


### February 2024

* PostgreSQL driver now keeps processing the current queries and transactions
  after encountering a "prepared statement already exists" event.
* Implemented a new landing page to make userver even more nice&shiny! The whole
  project was done by üë®üèª‚Äçüíª frontend developer [Fedor Alekseev](https://github.com/atlz253);
  üßëüèº‚Äçüé® designers [hellenisaeva](https://github.com/hellenisaeva)
  and [MariaGrinchenko](https://github.com/MariaGrinchenko);
  üë®üèª‚Äçüíº manager [Oleg Komarov](https://github.com/0GE1). Many thanks for the
  awesome work!
* HTTP components::Server now has a static configuration option `address` to
  select network interface to listen to.
* gRPC futures now can be used efficiently with engine::WaitAny().
* Flush headers before starting to produce the body parts in HTTP streaming
  handlers, so a client can react to the request earlier. Thanks to
  [akhoroshev](https://github.com/akhoroshev) for the PR!
* Added tracing::TagScope for comfortable work with local scope tracing tags.
  Many thanks to [nfrmtk](https://github.com/nfrmtk) for the PR!
* `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` is now used in `userver_add_grpc_library`. Thanks to
  [Nikita](https://github.com/root-kidik) for the PR!
* New storages::postgres::QueryQueue class, mostly for executing multiple
  `SELECT` statements and retrieving the results in one roundtrip.
* @ref POSTGRES_TOPOLOGY_SETTINGS to control maximum allowed replication lag.

* Optimizations:
  * PostgreSQL driver now caches the low-level database (D)escribe responses,
    workarounds the libpq implementation and does not request query describe
    information on each request. This results in about ~2 times less data
    transmitted for select statements that return multiple columns, less CPU
    consumption for the database server and for the application itself.
  * On Boost 1.74 and newer the engine::SingleConsumerEvent::IsReady() now uses
    atomic load instead of a much less efficient atomic DWCAS.
  * gRPC deadline propagation now uses less `now()` calls and measures time
    more precisely.
  * About 16% faster HttpResponse::SetHeader due to using a vectorization
    friendly algorithm.
  * Improved Redis driver start-up time.
  * dynamic_config::DocsMap::Parse() and dynamic configs retrieval copies
    less strings.

* Build:
  * New Docker container for developing userver based projects
    `ghcr.io/userver-framework/ubuntu-22.04-userver-base:latest`. It
    contains all the build dependencies preinstalled and
    a proper setup of PPAs with databases, compilers and tools.
  * Switched to a modern python `venv` instead of the older `virtualenv`.
  * Use system provided Boost.Stacktrace if it is available.

* Documentation and Diagnostics:
  * Added fix hints for storages::postgres::InvalidParserCategory.
  * Clarify @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/pg_user_types.md
  * More references and info for the metrics documentation.
  * More documentation for dynamic_config::ValueDict `__default__` behavior,
    and for dynamic configs.


### January 2024

    clashing.
  * `lld` used by default if it is available and the compiler is clang
  * `bash` is not required any more by the build scripts.

* Documentation and Diagnostics:
  * storages::postgres::InvalidParserCategory now provides fix hints for some
    of the PostgreSQL misuse cases.
  * Document that compiler::ThreadLocal should be used instead of `thread_local`.
  * Documented dynamic_config::ValueDict and related dynamic configs.
  * Improved documentation for metrics by adding more references to
    utils::statistics::MetricTag, utils::statistics::Storage and
    @ref TESTSUITE_METRICS_TESTING "testsuite metrics testing".
  * Cleaner docs for the utils::statistics::Percentile.

  * Big rewrite of CMake logic. Now `userver_setup_environment()` function is
    used to setup the environment:
    - before:
      ```cmake
      include(third_party/userver/cmake/SetupEnvironment.cmake)
      add_subdirectory(third_party/userver)
      ```
    - after:
      ```cmake
      add_subdirectory(third_party/userver)
      userver_setup_environment()
      ```
    Requirements are not code generated any more and the default requirements
    used on `userver_testsuite_add_simple()` CMake function call.
    `add_grpc_library()` renamed to `userver_add_grpc_library()`.
  * `USERVER_PIP_USE_SYSTEM_PACKAGES` and `USERVER_PIP_OPTIONS` CMake options
    now allow building the userver without internet connection. Thanks to
    [Nikita](https://github.com/root-kidik) for the PR!
  * Curl library now downloaded automatically if no suitable version found.
  * Added missing check for Mongo in Conan. Thanks to
    [Pavel Talashchenko](https://github.com/pavelbezpravel) for the PR!
  * Fixed sanitizers error message in CMake. Thanks to
    [Kirill Pavlov](https://github.com/pavkir) for the PR!
  * Updated MacOS dependencies. Thanks to
    [Kirill Morozov](https://github.com/moki) for the PRs!
  * Added PostgreSQL 16 detection. Thanks to
    [linuxnyasha](https://github.com/linuxnyasha) for the PR!

* Optimizations:
  * Optimized Http::Cookie::ToString(). Thanks to
    [–ò–ª—å—è –û–ø–ª–∞—á–∫–∏–Ω](https://github.com/IoplachkinI) for the PR!

* Documentation:
  * Documented Secdist formats and added notes on possible environment variables
    usage instead of secdist.
  * Layout of reference pages changes. Now descriptions are at the top of the
    page rather than being after the list of methods and members.
  * Documented Mongo pool metrics at
    @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/service_monitor.md.
  * New @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/tutorial/grpc_middleware_service.md sample.
  * Switched to Doxygen 1.10 with our search patches upstreamed


### November 2023

* formats::json::Schema and validation function for it formats::json::Validate
  were implemented. Many thanks to [Aleksej Kamenev](https://github.com/ishiku) for
  the PR!
* PostgreSQL driver now auto detects the max pool size, see
  @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/pg_connlimit_mode_auto.md

  server::http::HttpMethod::kHEAD. Thanks
  to [Kirill Zimnikov](https://github.com/lirik90) for the bugreport and PR!
* PostgreSQL now has the following static config options:
  * `check-user-types` option to prevent service from starting if
    database is not ready for work (for example: some migrations were
    not applied).
  * `discard-all-on-connect` - to force running `DISCARD ALL` on new
    connections, which could be useful for some PostgreSQLs smart-proxies
    that reuse the same connections. 
* Boost.PFR 2.2.0 is now in use. The door for compile time reflection pull
  requests is now open!
* More metrics and fallbacks for logging errors.
* More tests for utils::datetime::MockSteadyNow. Thanks to
  [Aleksej Kamenev](https://github.com/ishiku) for the PR!

  `alert-on-failing-to-update-times` to fire an alert if the cache update failed
  specified amount of times in a row.
* Optimizations:
  * Caching of `dl_phdr_info` items is not ON by default, leading up to
    multiple seconds faster exception handling under heavy load when parts of
    the executable still being on hard drive rather than in memory.
    Use `USERVER_DISABLE_PHDR_CACHE` CMake option to disable it, if the
    framework reports `dlopen` usage after component start and there's no way
    to avoid it.
  * Optimized discarding logs by log level from 4ns to 2ns. Added CMake option
    `USERVER_FEATURE_ERASE_LOG_WITH_LEVEL` to totally eliminate all the CPU
    and binary size overhead from logging.
  * Implemented utils::SmallString::resize_and_overwrite() function as in C++23
    std::string. Thanks to [–ò–ª—å—è –û–ø–ª–∞—á–∫–∏–Ω](https://github.com/IoplachkinI) for
    the PR.
  * Up to an order of magnitude faster generation of HTTP response header via
    utils::SmallString usage. Thanks to
    [–ò–ª—å—è –û–ø–ª–∞—á–∫–∏–Ω](https://github.com/IoplachkinI) for the PR.
  * Faster logging of durations in tracing::Span, tracing::ScopeTime and
    friends.
  * Parsing inside storages::postgres::ResultSet now does not compute
    parsing-failure diagnostic information if parsing is successful.
  * Return PostgreSQL connection to pool earlier, before updating the
    statistics.
  * fs::RewriteFileContents() now does not `fsync` directories, dumping caches
    now also do not `fsync` directories leading to better performance while
    still properly restoring after server power-off. 
  * PostgreSQL typed parsing was optimized to not copy std::shared_ptrs.
  * TESTPOINT() and TESTPOINT_CALLBACK() now produce less instructions and
    guaranteed to not throw it the testpoints are disabled.
* Documentation:
  * @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/grpc.md now has a deeper explanation of
    middlewares
  * New @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/dynamic_config.md page and related samples.
  * Samples were significantly simplified, more static configuration options
    now have good defaults and do not require explicit setup.
  * @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/tutorial/build.md now contains information on
    how to build service templates. Information on how to build the framework
    tests was moved to scripts/docs/en/userver/tutorial/build_userver.md
  * Documented the server::handlers::ImplicitOptions.


### October 2023

    usage under most of the loads that do not use all the coroutines from pool
    at once.
  * ugrpc::server::ServerComponent now provides a `completion-queue-count` to
    scale better under heavy load.
  * Primary address string is now cached in HTTP server connection, leading to
    minor performance improvement.
  * cache::NWayLRU now works faster due to improved hashing logic.
  * Internal per-task timer size was reduced by 176 bytes.
  * Removed rcu::Variable usage on hot path of tracing::Span destruction,
    optimized writing of Opentracing files.
* Dynamic configs were changed:

### Beta (June 2023)

* Static configs of the service now can retrieve environment variables via the
  `#env` syntax. See yaml_config::YamlConfig for more examples. 
* New testsuite plugins userver_config_http_client and
  userver_config_testsuite_support turned on by default to increase timeouts
  in tests and make the functional tests more reliable.
* gRPC now can write access logs, see `access-tskv-logger` static option of
  ugrpc::server::ServerComponent.
* Now the waiter is allowed to destroy the engine::SingleConsumerEvent
  immediately after exiting WaitForEvent, if the wait succeeded.
* New dynamic_config_fallback_patch fixture could be used to replace some
  dynamic config values specifically for testsuite tests.
* Fixed utils::SmallString tests, thanks to

    uses less CPU and scales better on huge amounts of coroutines.
  * Minor optimizations for HTTP clients URL manipulations.
  * tracing::Span generation of ID was made faster.
  * clients::http::Request now does less atomic counters increments/decrements
    while the request is being built.
  * `mlock_debug_info` static configuration option of
    components::ManagerControllerComponent is now on by default. It improves
    responsiveness of the service under heavy load on low memory and bad
    hard drives.
  * engine::io::Socket now has an additional `SendAll` overload that accepts
    `const struct iovec* list, std::size_t list_size` for implementing
    low-level vector sends. Mongo driver now uses the new function, resulting in
    smaller CPU and memory consumption.
  * clients::http::Form::AddContent now instead of `const std::string&` 
    parameters accepts `std::string_view` parameters that allow to copy less
    data.

* Docs and diagnostics:
  * gRPC metrics were documented.
  * New documentation page @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/http_server.md.

    resulting in less std::string constructions and better performance.
  * TSKV escaping was optimized via SIMD, resulting in up to x10 speedup on
    long logs.
  * `mlock_debug_info` static configuration option of
    components::ManagerControllerComponent now allows to lock exception
    unwinding information in memory. It improves responsiveness of the
    service under heavy load on low memory and bad hard drives.

    macro now do two RMW atomic operations less and do not use RCU, that could
    lead to a dynamic memory allocation in rare cases.
  * PostgreSQL driver now does much less atomic operations due to wider usage 
    of std::move on the internal std::shared_ptr.
  * Added storages::postgres::Transaction::ExecuteDecomposeBulk function for
    fast insertion of C++ array of structures as arrays of values.
