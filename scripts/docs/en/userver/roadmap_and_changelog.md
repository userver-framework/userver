# Roadmap and Changelog

We keep an eye on all the issues and feature requests at the
[github.com/userver-framework](https://github.com/userver-framework), at the

## Changelog

### Beta (March 2023)

* Now logging of particular lines could be controlled by dynamic config. See
  @ref USERVER_LOG_DYNAMIC_DEBUG for more info.
* HTTP headers that contain the tracing context now could be customized,
  both for handlers and HttpClient, by feeding tracing::TracingManagerBase
  implementation into tracing::DefaultTracingManagerLocator (docs to come soon).
* User defined literals for different formats are now available at formats::literals
* Added crypto::CmsSigner and crypto::CmsVerifier as per RFC 5652.
* cache::LruMap and cache::LruSet now work with non-movable types.
* BSON<>JSON conversions now supported via
  json_value.ConvertTo<formats::bson::Value>() and
  bson_value.ConvertTo<formats::json::Value>().
* engine::CancellableSemaphore was implemented.
* Optimizations:
  * Mongo driver switched to a faster utils::statistics::Writer.
  * utils::Async functions now make 1 dynamic allocation less, thanks to
    [Ivan Trofimov](https://github.com/itrofimow) for the PR.
  * Getting the default logger now takes only a single atomic read. LOG_* 
    macro now do two RMW atomic operations less and do not use RCU, that could
    lead to a dynamic memory allocation in rare cases.
  * PostgreSQL driver now does much less atomic operations due to wider usage 
    of std::move on the internal std::shared_ptr.
  * Added storages::postgres::Transaction::ExecuteDecomposeBulk function for
    fast insertion of C++ array of structures as arrays of values.
  * Str[I]caseHash now uses a 5-10 times faster SipHash13
  * Redis driver now does an asynchronous DNS resolving, amount of heavy
    system calls dropped down noticeably.
* Build changes:
  * CMake option `USERVER_OPEN_SOURCE_BUILD` was removed as the build is always
    the same for in-house and public environments.
  * CMake option `USERVER_FEATURE_SPDLOG_TCP_SINK` was removed as now the
    implementation of the sink does not rely on spdlog implementation.
  * Configuration step was made much faster.
  * Makefile was simplified and only up-to-date targets were left.
  * Added a script to prepare docker build, see @ref md_en_userver_docker for
    more info.
  * Scripts for generating CMakeLists were simplified and cleared from internal
    stuff.
  * Added missing dependencies to @ref md_en_deps_ubuntu_20_04 and sorted all
    the dependencies, thanks to [Anatoly Shirokov](https://github.com/anatoly-spb)
    for the PR.
* Statistics and metrics now do additional lifetime checks in debug builds to
  catch improper usages.
* Push functions of concurrent::MpscQueue and other queues now have a
  `[[nodiscard]]` for compile time misuse detection.
* Significant improvement of Redis server-side errors diagnostic.
* Improved diagnostics for distributed locking.
* Fixed numerous typos in docs and samples.
