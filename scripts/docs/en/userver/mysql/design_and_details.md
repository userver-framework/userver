## MySQL driver design and implementation details 

### Driver Architecture
Like most drivers in üêô **userver** the uMySQL driver consists of three logically
separate layers:
1. User-facing side - component, client interface, result types etc..
2. Driver infrastructure - topology, connections pools, some
helpers/wrappers, configs/logging/metrics and so on
3. The communication layer, which is responsible for an actual interaction
with a service a driver is built for (MySQL/MariaDB in our case)

Briefly, all these layers are glued like this:
1. User-facing layer takes an input from the user, converts it into some
internal representation and asks the infrastructure layers to execute a
request.
2. Infrastructure layer finds an appropriate connection and executes a
request on it.
3. The communication layer, to which a connection belongs, converts internal
representation acquired at step 1. into native representation, executes a
request and converts native response into internal representation.
4. After infrastructure layer executed a request and returned,
user-facing layer converts internal representation of a response into
whatever user requested.

There actually isn't that much to tell about infrastructure layer - it's
just a bunch of connections pools, defined by topology, where every pool
maintains some lockfree storage of connections and rents them to user-facing
layer. <br>
Communication layer and user-facing layer, however, are a different
story, since they have to do some magic to not only make user types work out
of the box, but also make containers of user types work seamlessly as well.

### Welcome MYSQL_BIND
`MYSQL_BIND` is a structure used by mariadbclient and mysqlclient for
binding prepared statement parameters/result from/to `C` types. When a
statement is executed for every parameter marker in it mariadbclient (we'll
only talk about mariadbclient here, since that is what driver uses) feeds
the data from corresponding `MYSQL_BIND` to a server, and when a statement
execution results are fetched from the server mariadbclient populates
`MYSQL_BIND` with data. <br>
These processes are different, and we'll talk about input/output parts
separately.

For input parameters binding `MYSQL_BIND` resembles to this:
```
struct MYSQL_BIND {
    enum_field_types buffer_type;
    void* buffer;
    unsigned long buffer_length;
};
```
which is self-explanatory; <br>
* to bind a not engaged optional one should set `buffer_type` to
`MYSQL_TYPE_NULL`
* to bind an `int a` one should set `buffer_type` to `MYSQL_TYPE_LONG` and
`buffer` to `&a`, <br>
* to bind a `std::string str` one should set `buffer_type` to
`MYSQL_TYPE_STRING` and `buffer/buffer_length` to `str.data()/str.size()`
accordingly
* ...

you get the idea. For types that have no corresponding counterpart (say,
`std::chrono::...` or `userver::formats::json::Value`) one should first serialize
them to something mariadbclient understands and bind that serialized
representation. <br>
This is cool and all, and it should be pretty straightforward by now how to
specialize some templates for selected subset of types (ints, strings and so
on) for binding, but how does one make it work with unknown upfront
user-defined aggregates?

### Welcome boost::pfr
And this is `some magic` part. By none other than lead maintainer of userver
Antony Polukhin himself, <br>
`boost::pfr` library is `std::tuple like methods for user defined types
without any macro or boilerplate code`, which allows one to do this:
```
struct MyAggregate final {
   ...
};
constexpr auto fields_count = boost::pfr::tuple_size_v<MyAggregate>;
boost::pfr::for_each_field(MyAggregate{}, [](auto&& field) {});
```
It has some limitations but in general "just works", and with it the driver
can
1. Initialize an array of `MYSQL_BIND` of size needed
2. For every field `F` of an aggregate `T` find an appropriate bind function
3. Bind the value of `F` into corresponding MYSQL_BIND

C++ templates are something else indeed.

### Batched INSERT
MariaDB 10.2.6+ supports batched inserts and mariadbclient also supports it
(in general it supports an array or params in prepared statement), as one
could expect. <br>
The API is pretty straightforward: <br>
Generate some binds, set `STMT_ATTR_ARRAY_SIZE` to specify amount of rows,
set `STMT_ATTR_ROW_SIZE` to specify a row size, so mariadbclient can do its
pointers arithmetic, and you are good to... Hold up. <br><br>
`Pointers arithmetic`, right, that's the catch. Mariadbclient being `C`
library expects (and rightfully so) user data to be a `C` struct as well,
and API expects an array of these structs to be contiguous in memory,
so it can add `STMT_ATTR_ROW_SIZE` to `MYSQL_BIND.buffer` go get the field
buffer of the next row. <br>
We could generate a `std::vector` of tuples of conforming `C` types, but
that is a potentially heavy allocations and a lot of difficult to understand
metaprogramming, and turns out there is a better way:
`STMT_ATTR_CB_PARAM`.<br>
This is an undocumented feature (https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-348)
and is used in only 2 repositories across all the github (guess where,
`mariadb-connector-c++` and `mariadb-connector-python`), but it's there
since Dec 3, 2018 therefore i consider it stable enough.<br> Basically it
allows one to specify a callback which will be called before mariadbclient
copies data from MYSQL_BIND into its internals, and with it instead of
transforming user container into `std::vector` we can maintain a mere
iterator of that user container, and when prebind callback fires just
populate the binds and advance the iterator. <br> Voila, no heavy
metaprogramming (to transform user type into tuple of `C` types), no
intermediate allocations; a thing of beauty IMO.

### Results extraction
The part responsible for that `.AsVector<T>` API. Uses the same machinery
with `boost::pfr`, but binding is done differently: you see, for input
params we already know all the things necessary - whether an `std::optional`
contains a value, what is the length of `std::string` we are binding etc. -
but for output we don't before the data is actually fetched; luckily
`MYSQL_BIND` has us covered. <br>

For output fields `MYSQL_BIND` resembles to this:
```
struct MYSQL_BIND {
    enum_field_types buffer_type;
    void* buffer;
    unsigned long buffer_length;
    unsigned long* length;
    bool is_null_value;
    bool* is_null;
};
```
When initializing a bind for an output field one can set `length` to
`&buffer_length` and `is_null` to `&is_null_value`, and then follow this
process:
1. Try to fetch another row from the result (we buffer the whole result on a
client in most cases, so that doesn't do any I/O).
2. If that returns `MYSQL_NO_DATA` we are done.
3. At this point mariadbclient updated the pointers we supplied into bind (
but didn't pull any data into it just yet) so we know whether a field is a
NULL or not and of what length its buffer is, so we fix the bind and the
user type associated with it accordingly: call `.resize` for strings,
`.emplace` for optionals, allocate intermediate buffers if needed (there are
some type, say, `userver::formats::json::Value` for which we can't just `.resize()`).
4. For every column we fetch the data into corresponding bind.
5. For every column that needs an intermediate buffer we deserialize the
user type from that buffer.
There is a funny catch tho - mariadbclient completely disregards `buffer`
being nullptr for numeric types and just writes into it if a value is
present in DB, so for optionals of numeric types we
`.emplace()` them at bind stage and `.reset()` at fetch stage if null.

User types are created and stored in container in user-facing layer, which
implements `AsContainer<Container>` like this:
1. Create a `Container::value_type{}`.
2. Bind that newly created instance into output binds via `boost::pfr`.
3. Try to fetch the next row of data, and stop if there aren't any.
4. Emplace the fetched `Container::value_type` instance into result
`Container` and go to step 1.

There are some optimizations implemented:
* we don't have to create a `T` on stack and then move it into vector, we
can just `.emplace()` into vector and operate on its `.back()`; but since
that doesn't work in general (say, `unordered_set`), we only do that for
white-listed types.
* we don't have to call `mysql_stmt_bind_result` for every new row - it
copies all the binds supplied, which is 112 bytes per bind, and is a huge
overhead, - we can just reuse the binds mariadbclient has copied after first
call. There is no API to extract them (but a field is there and `C` structs
aren't that private) so strictly speaking it might break one day... but
likely won't. https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/CONC-620
* we don't have to fetch a column again if the initial row-wide fetch for
that column succeeded
