## Redis

The redis asynchronous driver provides an interface to work with Redis
standalone instances, as well as Redis Sentinels and Clusters.

Take note that Redis is not able to guarantee a strong consistency. It is
possible for Redis to lose writes that were acknowledged, and vice
versa.

## Main features

* Convenient methods for Redis commands returning proper C++ types
* Support for bulk operations (MGET, MSET, etc). Driver splits data into smaller
  chunks if necessary to increase server responsiveness
* Support for different strategies of choosing the most suitable Redis instance
* Request timeouts management with transparent retries
* TLS connections support
* @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/deadline_propagation.md
* Cluster autotopology


## Redis Guarantees

Redis is not a reliable database by design. In case of problems on the server
side, partial or complete loss of data is possible. When a master migrates, the
entire Redis cluster may become unavailable for several tens of seconds. The
specific latency value should be determined for each Redis configuration
separately (depending on the size of the database, server location, etc.).

Every command that is sent to the server has the potential to fail. Moreover,
the client may receive error information (for example, a timeout), but the
command on the server may succeed. Therefore, Redis commands should be
idemponent. If this is not possible for some reason, then care should be taken
to ensure that incomplete groups of commands/resent commands do not leave the
database in an inconsistent state.

Redis command has a timeout, number of replays, and a global timeout. If a
response is not received from the server within the timeout, then the same
command is sent to another server in the cluster, and so on either until the
limit on the number of repetitions is reached, or when the global timeout is
reached. These settings can be changed via redis::CommandControl.

@warning For the above reasons, it is recommended to prefer PostgreSQL database
         over Redis. However it is fine to use Redis as a distributed cache.

## Metrics

| Metric name           | Description                              |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| redis.instances_count | current number of Redis instances        |
| redis.last_ping_ms    | last measured ping value                 |
| redis.is_ready        | 1 if connected and ready, 0 otherwise    |
| redis.not_ready_ms    | milliseconds since last ready status     |
| redis.reconnects      | reconnect counter                        |
| redis.session-time-ms | milliseconds since connected to instance |
| redis.timings         | query timings                            |
| redis.errors          | counter of failed requests               |

See @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/service_monitor.md for info on how to get the metrics.

## Usage

To use Redis you must add the component components::Redis and configure it
according to the documentation. After that you can make requests via 
storages::redis::Client:

@snippet storages/redis/client_redistest.cpp Sample Redis Client usage

### Timeouts

Request timeout can be set for a single request via redis::CommandControl 
argument.

Dynamic option @ref REDIS_DEFAULT_COMMAND_CONTROL can be used to set default 
values.

To interrupt a request on the client side, you can use 
@ref task_cancellation_intro "cancellation mechanism" to cancel the task 
that executes the Redis request:

@snippet storages/redis/client_redistest.cpp Sample Redis Cancel request

Redis driver does not guarantee that the cancelled request was not executed
by the server.


### Redis Cluster Autotopology

Cluster autotopology makes it possible to do resharding of the cluster
without Secdist changes and service restart.

With this feature entries in the Secdist are now treated not as a list of all
the cluster hosts, but only as input points through which the service discowers
the configuration of the entire cluster. Therefore, it is not recommended
to delete instances that are listed in secdist from the cluster.

The cluster configuration is checked
* at the start of the service
* and periodically
* and if a MOVED response is received from Redis

If a change in the cluster topology was detected during the check
(hashslot distribution change, master change, or new replicas discowered),
then the internal representation of the topology is recreated,
the new topology is gets ready (new connections may appear in it),
and after that the active topology is replaced.
