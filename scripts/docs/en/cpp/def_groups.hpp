/// @defgroup userver_clients Clients
///
/// @brief Clients are classes that provide interfaces for requesting and
/// retrieving data usually from remove server.
///
/// All the clients are asynchronous. In other words, a request suspends the
/// current engine::Task and other coroutines are processed on the task
/// processor. The suspended task resumes execution on the task processor after
/// the data was retrieved.
///
/// It is a common practice to return references or smart pointers to clients
/// from a component. In such cases:
/// * a client lives as long as the component is alive
/// * and it is safe to invoke member functions of the same client instance
///   concurrently if not stated the opposite.
///
/// @see @ref scripts/docs/en/userver/component_system.md for information on
/// how to configure clients

/// @defgroup userver_http_handlers HTTP Handlers
/// @ingroup userver_components
///
/// @brief Handlers are @ref userver_components "components" that could be used
/// by components::Server to process the incoming requests.
///
/// All the HTTP handlers derive from server::handlers::HttpHandlerBase and
/// override its methods to provide functionality.
///
/// See @ref userver_components "Userver Components" for more information on
/// how to register components.
///
/// ## Configuration
/// All the handlers inherit configuration options from their base classes:
/// * server::handlers::HandlerBase
/// * server::handlers::HttpHandlerBase
///
/// All the components, including handlers, also have the
/// @ref userver_components "load-enabled" option.
///
/// ## Static configuration example:
/// Here's an example of the full config for the server::handlers::Ping handle.
