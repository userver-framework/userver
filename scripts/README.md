# userver: Scripts

Various helper scripts and data that does not fit in other folders:

* `add-missing-include.sh` - script that could be used to add missing includes into third-party sources that use userver (into your project :-) )
* docs - doxygen scripts, configs, docs, logos and pictures
* external_deps - script that generates CMakeLists.txt from YAML from within ../external-deps directory
* grpc - generators for the userver gRPC plugin
* postgres - helper script to generate PostgreSQL headers from documentation
* rabbitmq - installation scripts for the RabbitMQ server
* redis - redis commands generator (outdated?)
* docker - make a docker image with all the dependencies for building userver
* uctl - admin tool for every userver-based service
