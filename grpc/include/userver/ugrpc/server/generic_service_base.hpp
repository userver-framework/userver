/// @brief Allows to handle RPCs with dynamic method names.
///
/// To use:
///
/// 1. inherit from this class in e.g. `YourGenericService`;
/// 2. put `YourGenericService` in a descendent of @ref ServiceComponentBase,
///    e.g. `YourGenericServiceComponent`
///
/// Alternatively, just inherit from @ref GenericServiceBase::Component, with
/// the disadvantage that the service will not be unit-testable.
///
/// The API is mainly intended for proxies, where the request-response body is
/// passed unchanged, with settings taken solely from the RPC metadata.
/// In cases where the code needs to operate on the actual messages,
/// serialization of requests and responses is left as an exercise to the user.
///
/// Middlewares are customizable and are applied as usual, except that no
/// message hooks are called, meaning that there won't be any logs of messages
/// from the default middleware.
///
/// Statically-typed services, if registered, take priority over generic
/// services. It only makes sense to register at most 1 generic service.
///
/// ## Generic gRPC service metrics
///
/// Metrics are accounted for `"Generic/Generic"` fake call name by default.
/// This is the safe choice that avoids potential OOMs.
/// To use the real dynamic RPC name for metrics, use
/// @ref CallAnyBase::SetMetricsCallName in conjunction with
/// @ref CallAnyBase::GetCallName.
///
/// @warning If the microservice serves as a proxy and has untrusted clients, it
/// is a good idea to avoid having per-RPC metrics to avoid the
/// situations where an upstream client can spam various RPCs with non-existent
/// names, which leads to this microservice spamming RPCs with non-existent
/// names, which leads to creating storage for infinite metrics and causes OOM.
///
/// ## Example GenericServiceBase usage with known message types
///
/// @snippet grpc/tests/generic_server_test.cpp  sample
///
/// For a more complete sample, see @ref grpc_generic_api.
