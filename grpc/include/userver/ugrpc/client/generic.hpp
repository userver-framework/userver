/// `call_name` must be in the format `full.path.to.TheService/MethodName`.
/// Note that unlike in base grpc++, there must be no initial `/` character.

/// The API is mainly intended for proxies, where the request-response body is
/// passed unchanged, with settings taken solely from the RPC metadata.
/// In cases where the code needs to operate on the actual messages,
/// serialization of requests and responses is left as an exercise to the user.
///
/// Middlewares are customizable and are applied as usual, except that no
/// message hooks are called, meaning that there won't be any logs of messages
/// from the default middleware.
///
/// There are no per-call-name metrics by default,
/// for details see @ref GenericOptions::metrics_call_name.

/// ## Example GenericClient usage with known message types
