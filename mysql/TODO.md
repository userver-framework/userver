## The list of TODOs for uMySQL driver. 
For my personal use mostly, in no particular order

* More topologies (multi-primary, automatic primary detection etc.) (~10h)
* TLS (3h, think about file access if any)
* Better unit-tests with clear separation of what is tested (8h)
* Fault-tolerance/chaos tests (ages)
* CI for MySQL 5.7, MySQL 8.0+ and MariaDB (+ the same for testsuite) (6h)
* Logging, metrics and some tests for metrics (6h)
* Better testing setup (without that ugly bash we have right now) (4h)
* MySQL Cache - very similar to PGs one, just unify (4h)
